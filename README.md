# NEAT-JavaScript

This project is a JavaScript-based implementation of NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies), an evolutionary algorithm developed by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. Originally introduced in their 2002 paper, [Evolving Neural Networks Through Augmenting Topologies](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf), NEAT presents a novel approach to evolving artificial neural networks by optimizing both network weights and structures over generations.

In this implementation, NEATâ€™s principles are faithfully applied, emphasizing the algorithm's core components: speciation, crossover, and structural mutation. These elements enable neural networks to adapt in complexity as they evolve, making NEAT a unique approach to neuroevolutionary algorithms.

This implementation offers a clear, accessible codebase for those exploring NEAT and has achieved results comparable to the benchmarks demonstrated in the original paper, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development.
